# Gdscript func finder shortcuts

Very simple plugin that adds shortcuts to scroll to the previous and next func definitions.
Inspired by PICO-8 script editor where you use the 'page up/down' keys to move acress functions.

Shortcuts:
- Page Up : Go to previous 'func'
- Page Down : Go to next 'func'

## TODO maybes

Right now, it replaces the behavior of the 'page up' and 'page down' keys inside the script editor.
I could add a proper shortcut configuration in the future instead.
