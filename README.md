# Gdscript func finder shortcuts

Very simple plugin that adds shortcuts to scroll the code to the previous and next func definitions.

Inspired by PICO-8 script editor where you use the 'page up/down' keys to move across functions.

Shortcuts:
- Page Up : Go to previous 'func'
- Page Down : Go to next 'func'


# Configuration

You can set the `Use Shift` configuration in the ProjectSettings/Plugins/Gdscript Func Finder.

If you enable this, the scroll shortcut will only work when you are holding shift and you can use the page up/down keys with their normal scroll behavior.
